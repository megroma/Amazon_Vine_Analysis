## Summary
Based on these results there is not a positive bias for reviews in the Vine program. Reviewers not in the Vine program were more likely to give a positive review. Based on this I would not recomend utilizing the Vine program for the future products. 

### Further Analysis
To review this further I would recommend looking at more that just the total amount of 5 stars but the other ratings as well. If there are more 1 and 2 stars reviews that are vine this would further support not using Vine. However if the majority on non 5 star reviews are 4 stars, then a case can be made that Vine is still helpful.  We can also look at the content of the reviews to see if there were reasons it was ratied well or not that may be confounding.
